# Material Wise: Construction Products Commodity Price Tracker

A comprehensive web application for tracking, analyzing, and forecasting construction material prices based on raw commodity inputs and market trends.

## Project Overview

Material Wise provides a sophisticated platform for construction professionals, suppliers, and buyers to access detailed price information and forecasts for construction materials. The application shows how raw material costs influence finished product prices, helping users make informed decisions about material procurement and project budgeting.
